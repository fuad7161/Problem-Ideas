<p>Adnan is very excited about the problem. which he got from his teacher. But he is unable to solve the problem.</p>
<p>He gave the problem to chatGPT. But chatGPT doesn't give the correct answer. So he asks for your help.</p>
<p>In this problem, there is three operations... </p>
<ul>
    <li>1  X
    <li>2  L,  R,  <b>value</b>
    <li>3  X
</ul>
<p>In this opeartion..</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>In 1<sup>st</sup> Operation: </b><p>If the index is not explored, then explore this index and set the value of this index as 0.</p>
        <p>If the index is explored, then just set the value of this index as 0.</p></li>
    <li><b>In 2<sup>nd</sup> Operation: </b><p>Add the <b>value</b> to all index between the range L to R. <b>which are already explored.</b></p></li>
    <li><b>In 3<sup>rd</sup> Operation: </b><p>get the value of the index X</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input will contain <strong>Q (1&lt;= Q &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup>)</strong> number of queries.</p>
<p>In the next <b>Q</b> line will content those three operation.</p>

<h3>Constant</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1  X ; here <strong>(1&lt;= X &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup>)</strong>
    <li>2  L,  R,  <b>value</b> ; here <strong>(1&lt;= L<=R &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup>)</strong> and <strong>(1&lt;= val &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup>)</strong>
    <li>3  X ; here <strong>(1&lt;= X &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup>)</strong>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output only for <strong>q<sub>i</sub> = 3</strong> operations.</p>
<p>print "<strong>Value</strong>" of the index.
<h3>Example</h3>

<b>1st query:</b> 2 is exprolored and set the value as 0. <br>
<b>2nd query:</b> from range 1 to 3. we have only one index explored. which is 2. so, add 5 to the index 2.<br>
<b>3rd query:</b> 4 is exprolored and set the value as 0.<br>
<b>4th query:</b> from range 3 to 5. we have only one index explored. which is 4. so, add 3 to the index 4.<br>
<b>5th query:</b> 1 is exprolored and set the value as 0.<br>
<b>6th query:</b> from range 1 to 3. we have two index explored. which is 1,2. so, add 2 to the index 1 and 2.<br>
<b>7th query:</b> print the value of the index 1. which is 2.<br>
<b>8th query:</b> print the value of the index 2. which is 7. <br>
<b>9th query:</b> print the value of the index 3. which is 0 <b>(it's not exprolored yet)</b>.<br>
