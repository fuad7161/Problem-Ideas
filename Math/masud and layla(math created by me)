masud and laila are good friend. At the age of 20, masud went abroad to study.
That's why Laila is very disappointed. So she decided to meet with Masud as soon as possible. 
But Laila does not know where is Masud. So she went out to find Masud.

Laila will start looking for Masud from the 1th index. layla know the value of n and k. Laile will go to (1+ik)th index 
(where i = 0,1,2,3... 10^18) for find masud and buy gift.
from (1+ik)th index she will collect gift. the price of gift is (1+ik)%n; ('%' means MOD).
she will buy different prices gift.(NB: Don't buy gifts of the same price more than once)
Laila is weak in math. So Fuad and Imran will help her to calculate the total cost of the gift.
