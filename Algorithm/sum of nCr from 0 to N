for i = 0 to 10^5:
    sum += (nCr(n,i))%M
 here loop will continue from 0 to N;
 and every time I have to calculate nCr(n,i)
 here time complexity: loop -> O(n)
 and nCr(n,i) : O(n)
 total time complexity: O(n)*O(n) -> O(n^2)
but binary_exponential(2,n) -> O(log(n))

algo: sum == 2^n;
binary_exponential(2,n) % mod ;
